## cartesian product using a list comp

colors = ['black', 'white','green']
sizes = ['s','m','l']

tshirts = [(color,size) for color in colors for size in sizes]
print(tshirts)

##above loop is equivalent to below

for color in colors:
    for size in sizes:
        print((color,size))


tshirts = [(size,color) for size in sizes for color in colors]
print(tshirts)
